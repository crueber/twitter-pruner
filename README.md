## Twitter Pruner

This tool is used to prune tweets on twitter. It was heavily inspired by MikeMcQuaid's project (Twitter Delete)[https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/TwitterDelete]. None of his code was re-used, as this is written in Golang. Ruby is a good programming language, but if one wants to distribute binaries, it isn't ideal. Releases will be maintained for all major operating systems, so that people don't have to be familiar with a programming language to perform the task.

The features will eventually have (at least) parity with TwitterDelete.
* Delete old tweets and retweets with adjustable age preference.
* Unlike old tweets with adjustable age preference.
* Keep tweets with a particular like or retweet amount.

Uncertain on this one
* Delete tweets no longer exposed by Twitter API from a downloaded Twitter archive file


### Pre-reqs

You will need to get an app set up on Twitter in order to use this. Visit https://apps.twitter.com and take note of the following items, as you'll need them to run the pruner:

twitter_consumer_key
twitter_consumer_secret
twitter_access_token
twitter_access_token_secret

### Usage

Download an appropriate binary, and run it by typing `./twitter-pruner -h` in to the command console.

The basic command is this: `./twitter-pruner --key="<twitter_consumer_key>" --secret="<twitter_consumer_secret>" --token="<twitter_access_token>" --tsecret="<twitter_access_token_secret>"`
